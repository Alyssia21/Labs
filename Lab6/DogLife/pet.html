	<h1> How to Select A Pet?</h1>
	<p> Here is a step-by-step process of selecting the perfect pet for your home. </p>
	<ol>
  <li><strong>Why do you Want a Pet?</strong></li>
      <p>What type of pet are you looking for? Short of feeding and water maintenance there is usually no interaction required with fish. Though cats generally tend to be more independent than dogs, both require more of a relationship commitment from their owners. Pocket pets (rats, mice, hamsters, etc.) can make fun little companions, but are usually short lived. Birds with appropriate upbringing and training can also be friendly and entertaining.

	You will find that every animal will have its own set of needs for daily care, nutrition, housing, and grooming.</p>
  <li><strong>The Perfect Pet</strong></li>
  <p>Consider your lifestyle in comparison to the needs of the pet. Some dogs demand their twice daily runs, while others prefer to snooze on the couch.  How much time will this pet remain alone at home? The hyperactive terrier will probably not tolerate long stints alone without boredom steering him into trouble. In contrast, a sedentary cat may not mind being alone for a day or two.</p>
  <li><strong>Pet Owner Responsibilities</strong></li>
  <ul>
  	<li>Plan Ahead for Pet Care</li>
  	<li>Consider Time Managemen</li>
  	<li>Commit to a Petâ€™s Lifetime</li>
 	 <li>Locate a Reputable Pet Resource</li>
  	<li>Take Your New Pet for Veterinary Exam</li>
  	<li>Read Your Adoption Contract Thoroughly</li>
  	<li>Always Look for Signs of Good Health</li>
  	
	</ul>  
</ol>
